# Video Game ideas

all the games should be for linux steam place. 

they should atleast be available an all 3 platforms. 

how we can make these games. 

where to start with? 

concept? 

game mechanics? 

game input? 


game type

competitive / story based ? 

fps

builder mechanic.. you build something

tower defense

cooperative large.

puzzle

like hollow knight

souls like .. dark souls

sekiro

animal crossing

battle royale.

math puzzles

vr games

board games.

tower defense.


Simulators.. I really don't like these kind of games. euro truck. 

games like gartic phone. purely web based games

miniclipy games. dave2d , cricket 

thing about games is that they are art product .
 
so they should be artistic at the very least. they should atleast be creative. 

and that's where the intersection would be. 

a game that is intense. and creative.

how about dota2 clone. valorant clone. 

do clones work in the gaming industry. 


how about a simple game with boxes
